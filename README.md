### Account Page
The account page allows you to create or log into an account. The account page also verifies that each user has a unique username and on login, confirms that the password is correct. There is also verification to make sure the username is at least 4 characters, and the password is at least 8 characters.<br>

If a user creates a new account, their settings are saved and uploaded to both cloud and local storage. If a user logs into an existing account, their settings are pulled from cloud storage, and the settings page is updated with the user's settings. Once a user signs out of the app, settings are set back to the default and their account is removed from local storage. When the app starts up, it will load the account that is stored in local storage. If a user taps on the "delete account" button, they will be signed out and their account will be deleted from both local and cloud storage.<br>

### Summative Assessment

The final phase of marking will be carried out at the end of the course.  This evaluation will be carried out more strictly, with higher expectations. In addition to your fully developed application, you will need to submit a technical report as a group effort, and each member will need to submit a ~5 minute demonstration video presentation of the app individually. This evaluation will be worth 50% of your final grade, divided into 30% (mobile application), 10% (group report), and 10% (individual demo). Students who do not submit any individual demo will receive a 0 for all parts of the summative assessment.

## How to Submit
The project starter is available on GitHub Classroom, which really just has this README.md, since I want you to have freedom over this project.  There wonâ€™t be any starter code, you will start from scratch.  Accept the invite link for this project on GitHub Classroom, and use the new repository generated to store your project files.  This is setup as a group project, so one person can sign up, and others group members can also contribute to the project in that new repository.  

The markers will use this repository to download the latest version of your project, along with other information (e.g. commit logs) available through Git, when they want to mark the project.

_**Note:**  Only one of the group members will accept the GitHub Classroom invitation.  It is recommended that every member of the team verify the final repository on GitHub on submission day, so that everybody can be sure that the correct files were submitted and on time.  You should also clone the latest version into a fresh directory, and run it locally on your machine to ensure that it works without any unusual configuration._

_**Note:**  Work equity will be evaluated using the Git commit logs for your project.  If you decide to work together which results in a misrepresentation of work equity in the commit logs, be sure to mention this in your `README.md`. The instructor will handle all issues of uneven distribution of work on a case by case basis, which may involve adjustments to project grades as needed._

To submit this project, please push all your work to your repository, and add the names of all group members names (but not their SIDs) and their corresponding GitHub usernames (so we can tell who made which commits) to the `README.md` file (at the top).

_**Note:**  Any instances of plagiarism will result in the student(s) receiving a mark of zero for the project, and further disciplinary action will be taken.  Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:_
- Copying of (any amount of) work from the Internet, without proper citation
- Submitting a body of work, cited or not, that is primarily not your own work
- Copying of (any amount of) work from another student, past or present, without proper citation
- Allowing your own work to be copied by a fellow student
